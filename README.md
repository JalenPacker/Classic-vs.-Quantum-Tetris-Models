Senior Project: Enhancing Artificial Intelligence in Gaming Through Quantum Computing: Exploring Innovative Applications and Algorithms

My goal is to personally observe and identify the advantages and efficiencies quantum computing has over classical computing in a practical environment.

To achieve this, I have created two models: Heuristic (classical-computed) and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) (quantum-computed).
Why? The Heuristic model is one of the most widely used in the gaming world, and the QAOA is said to particularly excel in puzzle-solving.

While these models play Tetris, I try to evaluate their performance through simple means like the elapsed time until game over and the score accumulated
  which contains a combo system rewarding extra points for consecutive scoring -- this way I can get better insight into the models' decision-making complexity.
